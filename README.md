# Render Math Equations in Markdown

Math formulae are written using latex in text books and all printed materials. On the web latex can be rendered using mathjax, a javascript library.  
We can simply use its cdn and tune some settings to begin our work.

This repo demostrates not only how to use mathjax to render math formulae but also how to set a nice theme to our static pages on github.  
> Like [this](https://mantejjosan.github.io/tutorials). is a themed static page.

This is an example [math site](https://mantejjosan.github.io/math-made-easy/) maintained under this repo.
